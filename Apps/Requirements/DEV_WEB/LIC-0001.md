# Concurrent Licensing

## Business Requirements

In order to maximise software value over split shifts, job shares and different time zones, a concurrent licensing model is required.

The customer can have as many users registered for the application as they require, however, only the licensed qty can be active at any one time. The customer should be able to set the time out window in the settings, we should impose a minimum and maximum time, for example a minimum of five minutes and a maximum of 60

What we need to avoid is the customer having to wait for one of the other users to be timed out, they need a mechanism for logging out a user if required.

The server needs to record how many times a license was not available, this needs to be recorded as a date/time, this data will be stored on a rolling sixty days.



<br/>

## Functional Requirements
Once a user logs in the user experience should be seamless, and not keep having to log back in. After a period of inactivity, the license will become available to others. 


If the user comes back after the license has become available and there are no available licenses, an informational message should display 'No available licenses, please contact IT'

<br/>

## Technical Requirements

Add a new application for Mobile Field Service Back Office.

Add the license key to the license repository object


### Database

Create a session table in the customer database
- Name
- SessionID
- LastUpdated
- License (in use/available)


<br/>

### API

All calls to make a check whether there are any free sessions

All calls to update the session table

Look at the customer application to see how many concurrent licenses there are
Look at the session table to see whether there are 

If there are not enough sessions then return ConcurrentLicenceCheck flag as false


**/Login**

Check whether there are any licenses free

**/Logout**

Clear the session

**/CheckLicenses**

Endpoint which can be called by the front end every hour to see if there are any licenses.

<br/>

### Front End

Call check licenses every hour. If it fails, display a message saying user will need to log back in

Every API call will return a ConcurrentLicenceCheck flag. If false then the user will need to log in again.

### Epicor

Add a field to the parameter screen stating how long the timeout for concurrent licences is, in lieu of a setting page on the back office

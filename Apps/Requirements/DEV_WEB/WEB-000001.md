## Business Requirements

Two Factor Authentication is required for logging onto all GHA web apps

<br/>

## Functional Requirements

### Process Flow and Details

When a user logs in, if it is more than 14 days since they last authenticated then:
- an email will be sent with a 2FA code
- a screen will be presented requiring the code to be entered
- on submission there will be the following checks
	- the code was issued within the last five minutes, if not another code needs to be generated
  - the code is invalid, request another
  - the code is valid - allow the user to log in

The 2FA should work on a customer by customer basis if a login is used for multiple customers.

## Functional Requirements

### Kinetic Screen
The user account needs to be customised as per the below image, 
![reqs_1.jpg](/reqs_1.jpg)

1. A new panel card is required to hold the required information, this is to be directly uner the detail panel card

2. A UD field to store the Requistion limit is required called GHA_User_ReqLimit_c which will be decimal

3. A UD field to store if the requisition limit is unlimited, called GHA_User_ReqUnlimited_c

4. A UD field is required to store the users supervisor, called GHA_User_Req_Supervisor_c, this will show oa combo of all other users in the system/ The user will be able to enter characters to restrict the users shown.

Required Logic

a requistion limit of zero is not unlimited, it is zero, if the unlimited checkbox is not ticked a supervisor is mandatory. if the inlimited checkbox is ticked a supervisor is not mandatory.

If unlimited is ticked, the value in the limit will be cleared.


### Classic Screen
The classic screen should be customised similar to the below

This button will be available to all users
When an requisition created by the employee has been updated a badge on the button will indicate somethign has changed

### Requisition View Page
Upon selecting the requisition button a page similar to the below should launch
![mims_2.jpg](/mims_2.jpg)

1. All requisitions raised by the employee should show in a list format, a setting on the paramter page will limit the quantity to show

2. A filter will allow the user to filter the results

3. The user will be able to create a new requisition using the new button

4. Selecting done will take them back to the home page

#### Logic

A long press on one of the rows in the grid will pop up a dialogue box, wich will give the user an option to open the requisition or cancel. If they open the requisition they will see the requistion detail page - detailed below.

When the new button is selcted a page similar to the following will appear
![mims_3.jpg](/mims_3.jpg)

1. The user will be able to enter or scan a part number

4. The user will enter a qty

5. Clicking in the notes section will scroll don the page to allow room for the keyboard, any comments from the approver will also show in here

# Maintenance Jobs
> **Requirement Specification**
> Date: 03/04/23
> Prepared By: Peter Roden
> Prepared for: Internal Development
{.is-info}


## Business Requirements

Maintenance jobs on Epicor are to be linked to GHA Mobile Field Service, similarly to the way service and installation jobs are.

## Functional Requirements

> Note this only covers maintenance of equipment that belongs to a company and is maintained on a company site. Equipment that is on a customer site will be maintained via service jobs and contracts
{.is-info}

A maintenance job for equipment on a customer site will appear on the Mobile Field Service apps.

> Maintenance jobs in Epicor are limited to a single site. Therefore in phase 1 only a single site will be supported
{.is-warning}

The job number, scheduling details, tasks/operations and materials can be taken directly from the job in Epicor

The customer/address details can be obtained from the site the job has been added onto

Equipment and serial numbers need to be displayed on the app and linked to job history

> Phase 2 will allow maintenance jobs to be created on a different site and use transfers to issue stock from the correct place

- Import sites as customers

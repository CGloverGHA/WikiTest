## Business Requirements

There has been an instance when a customer changed their firewall settings meaning the GHA applications (specifially mobile field service) could not communicate with their Epicor.

During the down time there were two days of transactions not deployed.

Customers require a warning system to tell them when their Epicor connection is down and a way to resync transactions which have errored during this time.

The resync can double as a way of resending any errored transaction back to Epicor

<br/>

## Functional Requirements

### Process Flow and Details

#### New service to check Epicor connection

Create a new service which will cycle through each customer defined in the database and each application with an Epicor connection defined, both live and test. For each Epicor connection the 'Test Connection' button from the License Portal Epcor connection screen should be mimiced.

If the connection test fails then a) email the administrator users on the customer account and b) log the failure to a table on the customer database

The cycle should be every so many minutes, defined in the global appsettings.


#### New screen on License Portal to resend bad transactions

Create a view which shows the failed records from the Message Logs

Add a filter for date range

![app000001_failed_records.png](/requirements/app000001_failed_records.png)

The records to be resent can be selected (with a select all on the header row). When resend is pressed they are sent to Epicor in the original order and the retries field is incremented.

The grid should not show any retries as if there should be another record created in the message logs.

{.is-info}

### Database
A new database will need creating. This table will be called "SyncLogs". This will be located on the GHALicensePortal database.

This new table will contain the following columns:

|Column Name|Type|
|-|-|
|ID|UniqueIdentifier|
|CustomerID|UniqueIdentifier|
|ApplicationID|UniqueIdentifier|
|FirstErrorTime|DateTime|
|LastErrorTime|DateTime|
|Success|Bit|

### Epicor Connection Service
The service will have to loop through all the customer's "EpicorConnection" table which will allow for the service to send epicor rest calls from the customer environment. The Rest Call which will be sent will just test the Epicor Connection. This means that the rest call will just be a get and if the appropriate response is returned then Epicor isn't down. However, if the response isn't a 200 http response then that means Epicor is down and a new record must be created.

When a bad response is returned a new record is created however, it will only send an email once and only one record will be created for this. Until this record doesn't fail then the Success column will be false and no one logs will be created and no other emails will be sent out.

#### License Portal
A new screen on the LicensePortal will be created. This will include a time filter allowing a user to select a time frame to view all the relevent errors.

The screen will grab error from the message logs tables which will be filtered using the Response column.

The screen will also allow a user to resend the calls using a button.

	incoming = 0
  retries = 0

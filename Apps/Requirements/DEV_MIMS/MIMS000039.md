The customer needs to be able to select lots for each lot-tracked part generated from the Kanban Receipts process.

## Pick Lots Screen
After the **Select Quantity** screen:
- The app should check if the quantity selection for each lot-tracked part is required

**If it is required:** The app should navigate to the [Pick Lots Screen](#pick-lots-screen)
**Otherwise:** The app should create the Kanban Receipt

## Pick Lots Screen
This screen should display
- The current lot-tracked Part Number as **Part Number**
- The required quantity as **Quantity To Issue**

The page should display a list of all available locations for this part
- Get this by calling `Erp.BO.PartBinSearchSvc/GetFullBinSearch`
	- With `ConsolidateInvAttributes: false`
	- Ignore empty lots (typically bad data but ignore anyway)

The page should have a scan button which will go by **lot number**

Once a location has been selected or scanned, navigate to the [Lot Selected Screen](#lot-selected-screen)

## Lot Selected Screen
This screen should display:
- Part Number as **`Part`**
- Required Quantity as **`Qty Req`**
- Quantity On Hand as **`Quantity on Hand`**
- Allocated Quantity as **`Allocated Quantity`**
- Warehouse Description as **`Warehouse`**
- Bin Number as **`Bin`**

There should be an Entry Input with the title **`Qty to Pick`**
- This should be a **numeric keyboard**
- This should default to the required quantity
	- Epicor requires it to be **exact** so ensure it is a **decimal**

Once selected, save it to application storage 

**If there are more lot-tracked parts to pick:**  Navigate back to the [Pick Lots Screen](#pick-lots-screen) for the next part
**If there are no more lot-tracked parts to pick:** Create the Kanban Receipt and navigate back to the home screen

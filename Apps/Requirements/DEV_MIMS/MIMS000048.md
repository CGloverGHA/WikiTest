## Registration (MIMS000048)

### Functional Requirements
The app shall allow the user to register their device using a license they have obtained on the License Portal.

Once a device has been registered, the user should not need to register again unless the device is revoked.
- The device can be revoked if it is deleted on the License Portal.
- The device can be revoked if too many concurrent licenses are in use.

The user should be able to manually enter the license information.

The user should be able to scan a QR Code, from the License Portal, to enter the license information using the Device's Camera. The User will do this by tapping the "Scan" button which will open a preview of the device's camera to

The user should be able to scan a QR Code, from the License Portal, to enter the license information using the Data Wedge Handheld Scanner.

The QR Code will be in the format `CustomerCode~LicenseKey~Environment`.
- `CustomerCode` and `LicenseKey` are provided in the QR Code from the License Portal.
- `Environment` can be optionally provided to specify the Environment in which the app will run against.

If registration fails, a relevant error message should be shown to the User. For example:
- Because the Customer Code is invalid.
- Because the License Key is invalid.
- Because the Environment is invalid (Using QR Code from different Environment).
- All licenses have been used.
- No free concurrent licenses.

If registration succeeds, the registration information should be saved so that registration is not required on subsequent app launches. It should also navigate to the login page. This will be default page for subsequent app launches.

Each time the app launches. The app should check if the device is registered.

If the device is no longer registered, the saved details should be erased and device registration will be required again.

If the device is still registered, the app will launch as normal from the login page.

## Welcome The User
```gherkin
Feature: Show a Welcome Page for unregistered devices
	As a User
	I want to be welcome to the application
	So that I know what app I am using and what version I am running

	Scenario: User opens the application with an unregistered device
		Given the user is using an unregistered device
		When the user opens the app
		Then the page should include the name of the application
		And the page should include the version of the application
        
	Scenario: User opens the app with an unregistered device in demo mode
		Given the user is using an unregistered device
		And the user is in demo mode
		When the user opens the app
		Then the page should include the name of the app
		And the page should include the version of the app
		And the page should include the text "Demo"
```

### Functional Requirements
When the User opens the app with an unregistered device, a welcome screen should be displayed.

This screen should display a welcome text including the name of the application (Mobile Inventory Management System)

This screen should display the app version so the User knows which version of the app they are running.

This screen should contain a button that will take the User to the registration screen / process.

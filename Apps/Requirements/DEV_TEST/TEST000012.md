The second combo will show all the languages supported by the app (web or mobile).

The grid will display three columns. The first two will show the base (English) translation file, separated into sections. The third column will display the appropriate tranlation in the target language. The first two columns will be read only, only the last column will be editable.

The All/Missing slider will select between showing the whole file or just any translations missing from the target language file.

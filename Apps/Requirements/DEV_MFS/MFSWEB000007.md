# Requirements Template

> **Requirement Specification**
> Date: 01/01/23
> Prepared By: Peter Roden
> Prepared for: Internal Development
{.is-info}

## Business Requirements

> **Why** are we making the change?
> Part of the Ongoing MFS Project to allow viewing of available times on the scheduling calendar
{.is-info}

<br/>

## Functional Requirements

### Shift- Availability

The scheduler will need to know the start and end time of the technicians daily shift, this will then be shown in a different colour on the calendar.

I would also like to see the earliest availability start time and latest available end time (overtime) as a different colour at each end of the normal working hours

Colours to be set on Preferences page and to be shown as a bar with overtime colour at either end of shift colour

Colours to be defined on the settings page

### Planned & Un-Planned Abscenses
The scheduler will show non-availability of the technician, no details will be shown, Colours to be defined on the settings page.

### Vehicle Avaiilability
Ideas if tech is tied to the vehicle, vehicle unavailability is shown, but does not stop scheduling, another colour for preferences page.
> This is part of the Fleet management module and is not part of this stage

### Working Logic
Can the scheduler assign jobs in periods of non-availability?

#### Outside of normal Overtime
yes, pop-up message, verifying the status.

#### During a planned-unplanned absence
No

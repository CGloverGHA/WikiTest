## Business Requirements

When creating a field service call it may be neccessary to populate tasks and materials from a previous call.

<br/>

## Functional Requirements

### Process Flow and Details



<br/>


## Technical Requirements

### API

Two new endpoints

- /CallMethod(CallNum)
  
Returns a cut down call with just the details, tasks and materials for viewing within the history
  
- /CopyCall(CallNum, CopyFromCallNum)

Copies the details (tasks and materials) from one call to another

Sends a message to Epicor Sync service to delete all existing tasks and materials and add new ones from the template call.

Will only work if the job has not been released.

<br/>

### Front End

Select a call/job in the history panel and view details (from /CallMethod). 

If call is linked to a job then clicking Copy button will call /CopyCall.

<br/>

### Epicor

First a series of messages will be sent to delete existing operations and materials from Epicor.

This will only work if the tasks and materials are in sync between MFS and Epicor

Then another series of messages will be sent to add operations and materials to the job in Epicor

> **Out of scope**
> Do we need to stop calls/jobs in Epicor being edited in Epicor if they have come from MFS?

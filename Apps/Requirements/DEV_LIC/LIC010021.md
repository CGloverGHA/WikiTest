## Business Requirements

> **Why** are we making the change?
This change is for when changes are made to the license portal

<br/>

## Functional Requirements

On the GHA version of the License portal we have a section for comments which will then appear on customers home page. We need to add to this a link to the WIKi for any API changes as per the picture
![wiki_one.png](/wiki_one.png)

When the customer logs in, they will see the following 
![wiki_2.png](/wiki_2.png)

the button will then take them to the wiki page for the changes.



### Business Rules and Data Requirements

If no wiki link is entered into our admin page, then the button will not be visible
Once the user has clicked the link, the message will clear from the customer page.

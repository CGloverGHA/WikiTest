# 1-2-2 View App Version

On the application screen on the License Portal a new column has been added. This allows both GHA admins and customer to view what version certain applications are. For example:

![image_2023-04-26_102700136.png](/image_2023-04-26_102700136.png)

For the Version of an application to be shown then the column "AppVersion"  on the table GHALicensePortal.dbo.Application must be populated.

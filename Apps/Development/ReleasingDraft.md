# Releasing Draft

If a file on the Wiki contains a draft version then that file should be used to make any sort of changes.

The current apps that are using drafts are:

When releasing a draft the draft should be duplicated and saved under {app name} / {version}

This will add the draft into the live folder under a version number

following this the Apps Home should be changed to point at the new version

Currently any Hot Fixes will have to go through the same procedure.

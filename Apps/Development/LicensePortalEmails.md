## Admin email
After any of emails have been sent out an admin email is created. This email consists of all the emails that have been sent out and contains all of the email addresses that recieved the email. This admin email is sent out to any email address which is located in GHALicensePortal.dbo.AppSettings in the LicensePortalAdmin - Emails Row.

Also upon sending an email a email log is created which can be viewed in the License Portal when logged in as an Admin user or can be viewed in the GHALicensePortal.dbo.EmailLogs database.

# Agenda

### Log Monitoring Service

Deployment to be set up with connection string to use gmsa account

Will be set up by 12thJan

Not done due to weather - wil do before the next meeting

<br/>

### Dev SQL Server Certificate

Does the Dev SQL server have a SSL certificate?

<br/>

#### Context
Entity Framework Core (EF Core) makes use of the `System.Data.SqlClient` package. As of EF Core 7, SQL Connection Strings have `Encrypt=True` by default ([Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-7.0/breaking-changes?tabs=v7#encrypt-true
)). If we choose to upgrade our packages in the future, SQL connections will fail due to the following error: 
```
The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted
```

There are three ways to fix it [Source](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-7.0/breaking-changes?tabs=v7#mitigations):
1. Add `Encrypt=false` to the Connection String
2. Add `TrustServerCertification=true` to the Connection String
3. "Install a valid certificate on the server"

If we go with option 1 or 2, we will disable encryption & certificate checking (which is what we're doing currently). **We will also need to add the property to the Connection String in the `Customers` table.**

**Option 3** should be the most ideal since it shouldn't require any changes (to the data) and would enable encryption. It does require a certificate from a trusted authority (Commercial providers such as LetsEncrypt should be trusted). If it is not trusted, we will get the error we currently get (`The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted`)

**No further work done 22/1/24**


<br/>

### New Dev Server

New server will replace GHAUKDVCH01 and GHAUKDVCH02 servers, and GHAUKDVSQL

Free up ~20% of resources in GHA cloud environment

Static IP address not available at Landmark, so looking at creating a tunnel between the Landmark and a third party service

Approval got by directors - will be going ahead with this - planned time frame two-three weeks

**22/1/24 - Charlie is going to start work on this this week**

<br/>

### GHA Epicor Upgrade

- Developer dashboard - revamped and available as a kinetic screen
- Project screen - pending (HOL)
- Project screen - pending (HOL)
- Case Entry (developers) - pending

**KanBan app**

AD is working on making this more usable for the development team

**Project/Issue app**

BW has completed phase one of the app

**Case Entry**

BW is working on a new case entry screen for Support

<br/>

### Pipelines

If somebody is running a long taking deployment it blocks out other developers from deploying eg nuget packages


- Azure DevOps with 5 users, 2 self-hosted runners, 2GB packages **~$12 a month**
- Azure DevOps with 10 users, 4 self-hosted runners, 4GB packages **~$66 a month**
- GitHub with unlimited users, unlimited self-hosted runners, 500MB packages (free plan) **free**
- GitHub with x users, 3000 minutes cloud runners, 2GB packages (standard plan) **~$4 per user a month**
- BitBucket with 5 users, unlimited self-hosted runners, no packages (free plan) **free**
- BitBucket with x users, 2500 minutes cloud runners, no packages (standard plan) **~$4 per user a month**

Azure DevOps is scalable per feature we would need whereas GitHub & Atlassian are fixed per user per month

***Need to encrypt connection string, API key and JWT token with secrets**

<br/>

### SQL Server connection issues

Field service sync failed again 31/12

When a connection is lost to the SQL server the field service sync services do not reconnect. To resolve these service need to be stopped and restarted.

Other services may be affected but they only run periodically. Restart all services anyway.

<span style="color:red">PR to document</span>

Is it possible for the service itself to check if the SQL connection is still there and reconnect if neccessary?

<span style="color:red">Dev team to investigate</span>

***Check again on
Tuesday, 30 January 2024
Thursday, 29 February 2024
Saturday, 30 March 2024
Monday, 29 April 2024
Wednesday, 29 May 2024***

### Trim logs

25% CPU usage on DEV02

BW to investigate

In the meantime trim logs need to be run manually

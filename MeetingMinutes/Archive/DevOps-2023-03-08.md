# Dev Ops Meeting

8th March 2023

## Attendees

* Gary Gedney
* Phil Manning
* Peter Roden
* Josh Sweeney
* Bart Wojda

## Agenda

# Outages
#### GMSA password reseting

GMSA account password  is reset every 30 days, this stops the sync services running as they do not reauthenticate

PR to manually restarted the services on 4th Feb
6th March - services did not need restarting

<span style="color:red">
Action - PR to manually restart the services on 29th April when the next reset is due
<br>
Action - PR to investigate if the reset can happen programmatically
</span>

# Documentation

## Technical Reference Guides
#### Mobile Field Service
<span style="color:red">
	To do - MFS Web app
</span>

# Container monitoring

#### MQ Check
Running every hour to check the size of the message queues and whether they are moving

#### AP Automation
Same functionality needs adding to AP Automation. Suggest write a timestamp to a log file and monitor if that timestamp has changed.

Action - JS to add logging to AP Automation service<br/>
Action - BW to develop monitoring tool
</span>


#### Health Check
* Add an endpoint to every API for `/HealthCheck` to make sure the service is runnning
* Add a new service check the healthchecks are running successfully and log
* Add a front end to display the results of the log (viewable on mobile devices)
* Notify support if the healthcheck fails

<span style="color:red">
Action - BW developing
</span>

#### Prometheus
Prometheus is implemented but the containers are not being monitored yet, look at writing to file for Prometheus to monitor heartbeat

# Container Management

#### Scripts
Containers currently running in Docker, managed using pipelines and in house services/emails (monitoring)

#### Server updates
Currently containers are restarted using a powershell script

Containers are restarted using pipelines.

<span style="color:red">
Action - JS to document process to restart containers if a server is restarted
<br/>
Action - JS to give PM access to Azure Pipelines
</span>

All dev servers are running on the new pipelines
GHAUKCH01 is running on the new pipelines
GHAUKCH02 is still on the old powershell scripts, will review next week (wc 13/2/23)

Release is now triggered by pushing code on the release branch, in case of accident or error a failsafe email confirmation will be added to the pipleline

<span style="color:red">
Action - JS to implement
</span>

#### Container environment

New Container environment – Moving to Linux VMs (depends on secrets being finished)
* Replace Ocelot with internal HAProxy LBs
* Linux with Docker for containers
* Implementing in Dev 1st

#### Kubernetes Rancher

Docker is increasing costs, look at Kubernetes Rancher as an alternative

<span style="color:red">
Action - PM to set up
</span>

A migration plan will be required when set up and tested

## Naming Convention

Added a suffix to each container, one of

* .api
* .service
* .frontend

# GHA App Security

#### Overall network infrastructure

We (Phil) are considering separating the apps/containers into different networks for additional security. At the moment everything is on the same network and configured manually which is OK for now but not future proof

#### Secrets

Secret storage for passwords used by containers for connecting to DBs

Josh has changed to (6/2/23) use Azure DevOps Environmental Variables
These are encrypted on the server but still stored as plain text in the containers

- Investigating 
<span style="color:red">
	DevOps Key Vaults and Hashicorp Vaults investigated
	Estimate a day to set up and deploy a cluster
</span>

#### API Authentication

Change from static API keys to token authentication
* Apps use internally generated JWT tokens
* Web pages use token authentication
* Epicor link (data directives that update field service) uses a static API key
	* Possibly update this on a schedule using a MFS service
	* Is using v1 authentication to Epicor (ie without API keys) sufficient

# Epicor Environments
* 98411

# SQL Server

Currently on SQL 2017
Will need to migrate to SQL 2019 planned for Q3
Upgrade to the server will be free

# Development Roadmap

## Printing Service

Customer potentialy going live 18th February

Hosted by GHA, but printers are located on Customer Site

Dev department to test printing in Epicor to a local printer

May need a BPM to facilitate

<span style="color:red">
	On hold
</span>

## AP Automation
Issues with the service stopping

Fixed 8/2/23

# Admin Service

Planning to move the current Admin API (which is called to create a new customer database) to a service
* Automatically create databases using message queue using suggested solution and creation process
* Automatically create message queues
* Manual password issue will be resolved
* Creating the replication stuff for SQL
* Secrets and secret API

Running on DEV

Uses azure secrets but credentials are saved within the container in plain text - PM not happy going live until this is resolved (see key vaults, see GHA App Security above)

<span style="color:red">
  Action - JS to investigate Key Vaults
<br/>
	Action - PR and PM to test and implement
</span>

Temporary measure - spin up the container, let it do its updates and destroy it again

# License/Mobile Portal

The following items need to be considered for the rewrite of the license portal

* Admin role to manage customers

# Customer Portal

### Parameter Screen

* Parameter screen is now written as a customisation for classic screens
* Kinetic need to look at using functions (and learning Kinetic) 

<span style="color:red">
Action - PR to look at Kinetic implementation
</span>

### Link from license portal to wiki for customers/users 
- done in development environment
- going to implement pipelines and test propely in dev before implementing live

# PEN Testing

* Quotes in (£12k, £30k) – waiting for decision on where to go next from Directors
* PM talking to Safenames about Cloudflare – pro plan will do some PEN testing for us

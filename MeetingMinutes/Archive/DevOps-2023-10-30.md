# Agenda

### Alerts to new CABs

PM not receiving CAB updates 
- Not included in the CAB update emails - resolved via license portal

<br/>

### Alberta CAB update - errors
- Looks like BPM Data forms have not imported in Alberta - PR to investigate
- Write a BAQ which lists all the customisations which should be installed and then a REST call to show whether they are - display differences on License Portal
- Have a dashboard that shows what should be installed and what actually is - if missing can we install? - Definitely a future development

<br/>

### CAB upgrades vs new installs
- Issue when doing a full install over an existing one - Solution Workbench is not that relaiable and sparks errors. Also takes a long time meaning it must be done out of hours.

- Propose to have two CAB files for each upgrade - a full install (for new customers) and a update CAB with only the changes from the previous version
- *OR* have major and minor releases - with a CAB file having multiple patch releases in it
- *OR* multiple smaller CAB files with just eg data directives, Forms, BAQS etc

<br/>

### New version of internal Epicor testing

- Forms fail validation - may need to force
- PR raised speed issues - PM suggested Kinetic forms - PR argued Kinetic forms not fit for purpose
- Development intending to write a KanBan board to assist Propjet and Case management
	- PM suggested using Teams and Graph API
  - Current development is Flutter front end speaking directly to Epicor

# Agenda

## Infrastructure
<br/>

### Container Environment
<br/>

#### Current State

Containers currently running in Docker, managed using pipelines and in house services/emails (monitoring)

<br/>

#### Future State

New Container environment – Moving to Linux VMs (depends on secrets being finished)
* Replace Ocelot with internal HAProxy LBs
* Linux with Docker for containers

Docker is increasing costs, look at AKS/Kubernetes Rancher as an alternative

**Kubernetes Rancher**

Plan to move all Dev stuff onto Rancher 

- Phil will set up 
- Josh will move to help with set up of containers and pipelines
- Hand over to Charlie

A migration plan will be required when set up and tested

When this is successful move onto live
<br/>

#### Network infrastructure

We (Phil) are considering separating the apps/containers into different networks for additional security. At the moment everything is on the same network and configured manually which is OK for now but not future proof
<br/>

### Container Monitoring
<br/>

#### AP Automation
Monitoring functionality needs adding to AP Automation. Suggest write a timestamp to a log file and monitor if that timestamp has changed.

> AP Automation has monitoring. As part of our Epicor Error Logging project, we will log the errors into Epicor

#### Health Check
* Add an endpoint to every API for `/HealthCheck` to make sure the service is runnning
* Add a new service check the healthchecks are running successfully and log
* Add a front end to display the results of the log (viewable on mobile devices)
* Notify support if the healthcheck fails

> We don't think we need this because of Kubernetes monitoring

#### Prometheus
Prometheus is implemented but the containers are not being monitored yet, look at writing to file for Prometheus to monitor heartbeat

#### Kubernetes Rancher

Kubernetes offers better monitoring, when implemented
<br/>

### Container management


#### Deploying

Containers are deployed using [pipelines](/ProcedureHome/Deployment/home)

#### Server restarts

Containers are restarted using [pipelines](/ProcedureHome/Deployment/redeployment-guide)

#### Outages

None to report

#### GMSA password reseting

GMSA account password  is reset every 30 days, this stops the sync services running as they do not reauthenticate

4th Feb - <span style="color:red">Data sync service needed restarting</span>
6th March - services did not need restarting
5th April - services did not need restarting
5th May - services did not need restarting
4th June - <span style="color:red">Data sync service needed restarting</span>
4th July - services did not need restarting
3rd August - services did not need restarting

### Server management

This section is for information only at the moment

> **Development Servers**
> GHAUKDV01 - Development Server - hosts Epicor
> GHAUKDV02 - Development Server - builds and hosts containers
> GHAUKDVCH02 - Testing Server - testing APIs
> GHAUKDVCH01 - Staging Server - staging APIs and services
> GHAUKDVSQL01 - SQL Server
{.is-info}

> **Live servers**
> GHAUKCH01/02 - Container hosts
> GHAUKAPP01/02 - Application hosts - Epicor and License Portal
> GHAUKAPP03 - Application hosts - Pilot Epicor environments
> GHAUKSQL01 - SQL Server
{.is-info}

### SQL Server


#### Upgrade

Currently on SQL 2017
Will need to migrate to SQL 2019 planned for Q3
Upgrade to the server will be free
<br/>


## Security
<br/>

### Application Security
* Web pages use token authentication, documented on wiki
<br/>

### API Security

* Apps use internally generated JWT tokens, documented on wiki
<br/>


### Deployment Pipeline Security
<br/>

#### Secrets

Secret storage for passwords used by containers for connecting to DBs

Josh has changed to (6/2/23) use Azure DevOps Environmental Variables
These are encrypted on the server but still stored as plain text in the containers

<br/>

### Penetration Testing
<br/>

#### Internal

Phil has tested web security 

License Portal - 

None of the mobile apps (apis) have been tested

**License Portal**

Phil has tested

Highlighted that the portal is using third parties with potential risk (bootstrap, font awesome, google maps api, cdn datatables)

**API Containers**

Not yet tested

#### Third Party

* Quotes in (£12k, £30k) – waiting for decision on where to go next from Directors
* PM talking to Safenames about Cloudflare – pro plan will do some PEN testing for us

### Epicor Security

* Epicor link (data directives that update field service) uses a static API key
	* Possibly update this on a schedule using a MFS service


#### Customisations

Which should be using in our CAB files for customers

</br>

</span>

#### Epicor Rest v1/2

* Is using v1 authentication to Epicor (ie without API keys) sufficient
  * Field service now implements v2 REST
    * Licence portal now allows you to add v2 and an API key

### Epicor client CABs

Available on 1password

### Licensing

How are we going to handle this in the future?

- Licenses next expire 31/12/23 - set a reminder
- Document

## Documentation
<br/>

### Wiki
<br/>

#### Two factor authentiaction

Implemented 24/7

<br/>

#### Updates


#### POD
The proof of delivery has three phases
- 1.1.1 Test in Kinetic
- 1.1.2 Create wiki pages
- 1.1.3 CABs

## Development Roadmap

<!--### Mobile Apps
<br/>
-->
<!--### APIs
<br/>
-->
### Services

**Admin Service**
Planning to move the current Admin API (which is called to create a new customer database) to a service
* Automatically create databases using message queue using suggested solution and creation process
* Automatically create message queues
* Manual password issue will be resolved
* Creating the replication stuff for SQL
* Secrets and secret API
<br/>

Running on DEV

Uses azure secrets but credentials are saved within the container in plain text - PM not happy going live until this is resolved (see key vaults, see GHA App Security above)
<br/>
The admin service, which appears to be working fine in the Development environment, cannot be deployed until the key vaults are implemented. This is becoming more urgent. A work around is to run a script in each customer directory to update the database schema. There was an instance this month (April) where the Alberta test database had not been updated and this caused issues with logging on the devices.
<br/>

>Currently a script does this - look at making into a single script (have to write an app to encrypt he connection string)

**Printing Service**
- Customer potentialy going live 18th February
- Hosted by GHA, but printers are located on Customer Site
- Dev department to test printing in Epicor to a local printer
- May need a BPM to facilitate

<br/>

**Epicor Rebuild**

- Finished
- Working as windows service on DEV server and environments
- Need to make a change to recycle both app pools on the fail over servers (2 minute delay)

<br/>
<span style="color:red">
- GG and PM to test on dev server
 <br/>
- PM to look at permissions to run service on live server
 <br/>
- BW to implement app server changes
</span>
<br/>

**Trim Logs**

Alberta message log size

### Parameter Screen

* Parameter screen is now written as a customisation for classic screens
* Kinetic need to look at using functions (and learning Kinetic)

## Agenda

# Outages
#### GMSA password reseting

GMSA account password  is reset every 30 days, this stops the sync services running as they do not reauthenticate

PR to manually restarted the services on 4th Feb
6th March - services did not need restarting
5th April - services did not need restarting
5th May - services did not need restarting
4th June - <span style="color:red">Data sync service needed restarting</span>
4th July
3rd August
2nd September
2nd October
1st November
1st Devember

<br/>

<span style="color:red">
Action - PR to manually restart the services on 29th April when the next reset is due
<br>
- Again nothing needed doing
<br>
Action - PR to investigate if the reset can happen programmatically
</span>

# Documentation

## Technical Reference Guides
#### Mobile Field Service
<span style="color:red">
	To do - MFS Web app
</span>

# Container monitoring

#### AP Automation
Same functionality needs adding to AP Automation. Suggest write a timestamp to a log file and monitor if that timestamp has changed.

Action - JS to add logging to AP Automation service<br/>
Action - BW to develop monitoring tool
</span>

#### Health Check
* Add an endpoint to every API for `/HealthCheck` to make sure the service is runnning
* Add a new service check the healthchecks are running successfully and log
* Add a front end to display the results of the log (viewable on mobile devices)
* Notify support if the healthcheck fails

<span style="color:red">
Action - BW developing
</span>

#### Prometheus
Prometheus is implemented but the containers are not being monitored yet, look at writing to file for Prometheus to monitor heartbeat

#### AKS

Plan to move all Dev stuff onto AKS 

- Phil will set up 
- Josh will move to help with set up of containers and pipelines

# Container Management

#### Scripts
Containers currently running in Docker, managed using pipelines and in house services/emails (monitoring)

#### Server updates
Containers are restarted using pipelines.

<span style="color:red">
Action - JS to document process to restart containers if a server is restarted
<br/>
Action - JS to give PM access to Azure Pipelines
</span>

All dev servers are running on the Azure pipelines
GHAUKCH01 is running on the Azure pipelines
GHAUKCH02 is now running on the Azure pipelines

Release is now triggered by pushing code on the release branch, in case of accident or error a failsafe email confirmation will be added to the pipeline

<span style="color:red">
Action - JS to implement
</span>

#### Server space

The c: drive of the GHAUKDV02 server ran low. This was because of a large working directory of the Azure Pipeline agent (~25GB). The working directory has been moved to the d: drive.

#### Container environment

New Container environment – Moving to Linux VMs (depends on secrets being finished)
* Replace Ocelot with internal HAProxy LBs
* Linux with Docker for containers
* Implementing in Dev 1st

#### Kubernetes Rancher - Remove - replace with AKS

Docker is increasing costs, look at Kubernetes Rancher as an alternative

<span style="color:red">
Action - PM to set up
</span>

A migration plan will be required when set up and tested

# GHA App Security

#### Overall network infrastructure

We (Phil) are considering separating the apps/containers into different networks for additional security. At the moment everything is on the same network and configured manually which is OK for now but not future proof

#### Secrets

Secret storage for passwords used by containers for connecting to DBs

Josh has changed to (6/2/23) use Azure DevOps Environmental Variables
These are encrypted on the server but still stored as plain text in the containers

- Investigating

</span>

Phil to look at giving Josh access to GHA Azure set up

#### *Admin service

The admin service, which appears to be working fine in the Development environment, cannot be deployed until the key vaults are implemented. This is becoming more urgent. A work around is to run a script in each customer directory to update the database schema. There was an instance this month (April) where the Alberta test database had not been updated and this caused issues with logging on the devices.

#### API Authentication

Change from static API keys to token authentication
* Apps use internally generated JWT tokens
* Web pages use token authentication
* Epicor link (data directives that update field service) uses a static API key
	* Possibly update this on a schedule using a MFS service
	* Is using v1 authentication to Epicor (ie without API keys) sufficient

# Epicor Environments
* 98411

## Customisation/Base Extension

Which should be using in our CAB files for customers

## License Expiry in Dev (and other) environments

How are we going to handle this in the future?

- Licenses next expire 31/12/23 - set a reminder
- Document

# SQL Server

Currently on SQL 2017
Will need to migrate to SQL 2019 planned for Q3
Upgrade to the server will be free

# Development Roadmap

## Printing Service

Customer potentialy going live 18th February

Hosted by GHA, but printers are located on Customer Site

Dev department to test printing in Epicor to a local printer

May need a BPM to facilitate

<span style="color:red">
	On hold
</span>

## AP Automation
Issues with the service stopping

Fixed 8/2/23

Waiting for ABL, will be looking at again soon

## *Migration to dotnet 6

Need to look at migrating to dotnet 6 asap.

|Version|Original release date|Release type|Support Phase|End of support|

# Admin Service

***See note above under 'Security'**

Planning to move the current Admin API (which is called to create a new customer database) to a service
* Automatically create databases using message queue using suggested solution and creation process
* Automatically create message queues
* Manual password issue will be resolved
* Creating the replication stuff for SQL
* Secrets and secret API

Running on DEV

Uses azure secrets but credentials are saved within the container in plain text - PM not happy going live until this is resolved (see key vaults, see GHA App Security above)

<span style="color:red">
  Action - JS to investigate Key Vaults
<br/>
	Action - PR and PM to test and implement
</span>

Temporary measure - spin up the container, let it do its updates and destroy it again

## New customer backup

The admin service creates a customer database but this needs a full back up after creating otherwise the incremental backups give an error.

- Phil will look at his scripts to ignore new databases that have not had a full back up

# License/Mobile Portal

The following items need to be considered for the rewrite of the license portal

* Admin role to manage customers

# Customer Portal

### Parameter Screen

* Parameter screen is now written as a customisation for classic screens
* Kinetic need to look at using functions (and learning Kinetic) 

<span style="color:red">
Action - PR to look at Kinetic implementation
</span>

### Link from license portal to wiki for customers/users 
- done in development environment
- going to implement pipelines and test properly in dev before implementing live

### 2FA in wiki
- for administrators
<span style="color:red">
Action - BW to implement
</span>

# Epicor Rebuild

- WMI from within a container on a separate server
- Or run as a service on the Epicor server

Will set up both on Dev servers and review live server when Secrets etc have been implemented properly

# PEN Testing

* Quotes in (£12k, £30k) – waiting for decision on where to go next from Directors
* PM talking to Safenames about Cloudflare – pro plan will do some PEN testing for us

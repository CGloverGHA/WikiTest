<br>
Action - PR to investigate if the reset can happen programmatically
</span>

# Documentation

#### Wiki.JS Backups

Synced with github

#### Container Setup
Written up in Confluence

## Technical Reference Guides
#### Mobile Field Service
- Finished MFS App and Epicor connections and set up
- To do - MFS Web app

#### MIMS
- In Wiki.JS

## Hosting

Bart has began reconciling documents into Wiki.JS

Some documentaiton is being left in Confluence until needed.

# Container monitoring

#### MQ Check
Running every hour to check the size of the message queues and whether they are moving

#### AP Automation
Same functionality needs adding to AP Automation. Suggest write a timestamp to a log file and monitor if that timestamp has changed.

<span style="color:red">
Action - JS to add logging to AP Automation service<br/>
Action - BW to develop monitoring tool
</span>


#### Health Check
* Add an endpoint to every API for `/HealthCheck` to make sure the service is runnning
* Add a new service check the healthchecks are running successfully and log
* Add a front end to display the results of the log (viewable on mobile devices)
* Notify support if the healthcheck fails

<span style="color:red">
Action - BW developing
</span>

#### Prometheus
Prometheus is implemented but the containers are not being monitored yet, look at writing to file for Prometheus to monitor heartbeat

# Container Management

#### Scripts
Containers currently running in Docker, managed using scripts (to implement) and in house services/emails (monitoring)

#### Container environment

New Container environment – Moving to Linux VMs (depends on secrets being finished)
* Replace Ocelot with internal HAProxy LBs
* Linux with Docker for containers
* Implementing in Dev 1st

#### Kubernetes Rancher

Docker is increasing costs, look at Kubernetes Rancher as an alternative

<span style="color:red">
Action - PM to set up
</span>

A migration plan will be required when set up and tested

## Naming Convention

Add a suffix to each container, one of

* .api
* .service
* .frontend

<span style="color:red">
Action - JS to set up as part of the pipeline implementation
</span>

# Source Code Management
* Bitbucket
* Solution separation
	PR has a method of separating solutions, implemented on field service web and licening and apii gateway to date

# GHA App Security

#### Overall network infrastructure

We (Phil) are considering separating the apps/containers into different networks for additional security. At the moment everything is on the same network and configured manually which is OK for now but not future proof

#### Secrets

Secret storage for passwords used by containers for connecting to DBs

Josh has changed to (6/2/23) use Azure DevOps Environmental Variables
These are encrypted on the server but still stored as plain text in the containers

- Investigating DevOps Key Vaults
<span style="color:red">
	Action - JS to investigate
</span>

- Investigating Hashicorp Vault
<span style="color:red">
	Action - JS to set up (estimate a day to set up and deploy a cluster)
</span>

#### API Authentication

Change from static API keys to token authentication
* Apps use internally generated JWT tokens
* Web pages use token authentication
* Epicor link (data directives that update field service) uses a static API key
	* Possibly update this on a schedule using a MFS service
	* Is using v1 authentication to Epicor (ie without API keys) sufficient

# CI/CD Pipelines

Move away from powershell to automated pipelines 

|Application|Type|Pipeline|
|---|---|---|
|API Gateway|Gateway|DevOps|
|License|API|DevOps|
|Admin|API|Powershell Script, to be rewritten as a service|
|Field Service Mobile|API|DevOps|
|Field Service Web|API|DevOps|
|Epicor Incoming Service|API|Powershell Script|
|PO Approval|API|Powershell Script|
|AQS|API|DevOps|
|AQS|Front End|Dev commit will update container<br>Live update is manual|
|Field Service Web|Front End|Dev commit will update container<br>Live update is manual|
|Health Check|Front End|Powershell Script|
|ERP Outgoing (MQ)|Service|Powershell Script|
|ERP Sync (MQ)|Service|Powershell Script|
|AP Automation|Service|Powershell Script|
|Trim Logs|Service|Powershell Script|
|Message Queue Check|Service|Powershell Script|
|Health Check|Service|Powershell Script|

<span style="color:red">
Action - JS to continue converting scripts to pipelines. Dependent on code separation

Hosted by GHA, but printers are located on Customer Site

Dev department to test printing in Epicor to a local printer

May need a BPM to facilitate

# License/Mobile Portal

The following items need to be considered for the rewrite of the license portal

* Admin role to manage customers

# Customer Portal

#### CAB Files
* Agreed to the following process:
  * CAB files will be created from development environment
	* CAB files will be kept in a bit bucket repository so they can be versioned
  * CAB files will be installed in a test or staging environment by Development as appropriate
  * When tested and approved the CAB files will be moved to GHA Mods - New CABs. Currently only PR has access
  
* Thinking about using REST calls to update from License portal

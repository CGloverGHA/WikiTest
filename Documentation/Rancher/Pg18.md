# Documentation/Rancher/Pg18
## Deploy the nfs-server-provisioner into your Kubernetes Cluster

In a Kubernetes Cluster, it can be desirable to have persistent storage available for applications to use. As we do not have a Kubernetes Cloud Provider enabled in this cluster, we will be deploying the nfs-server-provisioner which will run an NFS server inside of our Kubernetes cluster for persistent storage. This is not a production-ready solution by any means, but helps to illustrate the persistent storage constructs.

1. From Apps & Marketplace > Charts install the nfs-server-provisioner app
2. In step 1 of the install wizard, choose the kube-system namespace and give the installation the name nfs-server-provisioner
3. In step 2 of the install wizard, you can keep all the settings as default.
4. Scroll to the bottom and click Install.
5. Once the app is installed, go to Storage > Storage Classes
6. Observe the nfs storage class and the checkmark next to it which indicates it is the Default storage class.

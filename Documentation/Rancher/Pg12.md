# Documentation/Rancher/Pg12

## Working with Rancher Monitoring
Once Rancher Monitoring has been deployed, we can view the various components and interact with them.

1. In the left menu of the Cluster Explorer, select "Monitoring"
2. On the Monitoring Dashboard page, identify the "Grafana" link. Clicking this will proxy you to the installed Grafana server

Once you have opened Grafana, feel free to explore the various dashboard and visualizations that have been setup by default.

These options can be customized (metrics and graphs), but doing so is out of the scope of this scenario.

You will also see new Metrics and Alerts section on the Cluster page as well as on the individual workload pages.

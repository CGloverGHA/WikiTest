# Documentation/Rancher/Pg17
## Deploy a Wordpress as a Stateless Application
In this step, we will be deploying Wordpress as a stateless application in the Kubernetes cluster.
1. From Apps & Marketplace > Charts install the Wordpress app
2. In step 1 of the install wizard, choose the stateless-wordpress namespace and give the installation the name wordpress
3. In step 2 of the install wizard, set:
• Wordpress settings > Wordpress password - to a password of your choice
• Services and Load Balancing > Hostname - wordpress.34.243.114.229.sslip.io
4. Scroll to the bottom and click Install.
5. Once the installation is complete, navigate to Service Discovery > Ingresses. There you will see a new Ingress. Click on the URL to access Wordpress.
• Note: You may receive 404, 502, or 503 errors while the wordpress app is coming up. Simply refresh the page occasionally until Wordpress is available
6. Log into Wordpress using your set admin credentials -  http://wordpress.34.243.114.229.sslip.io/wp-admin, and create a new blog post. Note that if you delete the wordpress-mariadb-0 pod or click Redeploy on the wordpress-mariadb StatefulSet you will lose your post. This is because there is no persistent storage under the Wordpress MariaDB StatefulSet.

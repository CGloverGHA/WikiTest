# Documentation/Rancher/Pg16
## Add a new chart repository

The easiest way to install a complete Wordpress into our cluster, is through the built-in Apps Marketplace. In addition to the Rancher and partner provided apps that are already available. You can add any other Helm repository and allow the installation of the Helm charts in there through the Rancher UI.

1. In the left menu go to Apps > Chart repositories
3. Click on Create in the top right
4. Enter the following details:
• Name - rodeo
• Target - Should be http(s) URL
• Index URL - https://rancher.github.io/rodeo
5. Click on Create

Once the repository has been synchronized, go to Apps > Charts. There you will now see several new apps that you can install.

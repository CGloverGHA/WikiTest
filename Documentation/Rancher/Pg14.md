# Documentation/Rancher/Pg14
## Create a Kubernetes Ingress

In this step, we will be creating a Layer 7 ingress to access the workload we just deployed in the previous step. For this example, we will be using sslip.io as a way to provide a DNS hostname for our workload. Rancher will automatically generate a corresponding workload IP.

1. In the left menu under Service Discovery go to Ingresses and click on *Create.
2. Enter the following criteria:
• Name - helloworld
• Request Host - helloworld.34.243.114.229.sslip.io
• Path Prefix - /
• Target Service - Choose the helloworld-nodeport service from the dropdown
• Port - Choose port 80 from the dropdown
3. Click Create and wait for the helloworld.34.243.114.229.sslip.io hostname to register, you should see the rule become Active within a few minutes.
4. Click on the hostname and browse to the workload.

** Note: ** You may receive transient 404/502/503 errors while the workload stabilizes. This is due to the fact that we did not set a proper readiness probe on the workload, so Kubernetes is simply assuming the workload is healthy.

2. Click Create Project in the top right
3. Give your project a name, like stateful-wordpress
â€¢ Note the ability to add members, set resource quotas and a pod security policy for this project.
4. Next create a new namespace in the stateful-wordpress project. In the list of all Projects/Namespaces, scroll down to the stateful-wordpress project and click the Create Namespace button.

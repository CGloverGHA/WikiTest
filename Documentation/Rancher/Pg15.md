# Documentation/Rancher/Pg15

## Creating Projects in your Kubernetes Cluster

A project is a grouping of one or more Kubernetes namespaces. In this step, we will create an example project and use it to deploy a stateless wordpress.

1. In the left menu go to Cluster > Projects/Namespaces
2. Click Create Project in the top right
3. Give your project a name, like stateless-wordpress
â€¢ Note the ability to add members, set resource quotas and a pod security policy for this project.
4. Next create a new namespace in the stateless-wordpress project. In the list of all Projects/Namespaces, scroll down to the stateless-wordpress project and click the Create Namespace button.
5. Enter the Name stateless-wordpress and click Create.

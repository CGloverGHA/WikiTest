# Documentation/Rancher/Pg11
## Enable Rancher Monitoring

To deploy the Rancher Monitoring feature:
29. Navigate to Apps in the left menu
30. Under Charts Locate the Monitoring chart, and click on it
31. On the Monitoring App Detail page click the Install button in the top right
32. This leads you to the installation wizard. In the first Metadata step, we can leave everything as default and click Next.
33. In the Values step, select the Prometheus section on the left. Change Resource Limits > Requested CPU from 750m to 250m and Requested Memory from 750Mi to 250Mi. This is required because our scenario virtual machine has limited CPU and memory available.
34. Click "Install" at the bottom of the page, and wait for the helm install operation to complete.

Once Monitoring has been installed, you can click on that application under "Installed Apps" to view the various resources that were deployed.

Step 2.) Head into the {New Cabs} folder under {GHA Mods - General} .

Step 3.) A new CAB file zip should appear.

Step 4.) Select this FILE AND CLICK "Ctrl + c" 

Step 5.) If this is a GHA Mod then head into the "Shared" folder. If this is customer specific then head into "Customer Specific" 

Step 6.) Look for the correct folder for that Mod. For example, if the new Cab file is for "Quote Revision" then look for the {Quote revision} folder. 

Step 7.)Within this specific folder. Create a new folder and name it with the version that Mod is for. (For example, if the mod is for K20232, Name the folder "ERPK2023.2"

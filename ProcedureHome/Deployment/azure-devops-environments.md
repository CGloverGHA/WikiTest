# Azure Devops Environments

Each project has environments setup to define what environments the given application deploys to.

## Resources

No resources have been assigned to the environments as of yet.

> NOTE: When we move to Kubernetes, Kubernetes resources may be defined here

## Approvals

Live environments have approvals defined so that the Development Manager must permit the deployment via email

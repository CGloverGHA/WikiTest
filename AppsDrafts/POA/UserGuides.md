GHA Purchase Order Approval App User Guide

This App will give an authorised PO Approver the ability to process PO Approvals while mobile. The approver has the ability to approve or reject the PO adding comments to support the decision made. Keeping the App open in the background on your device allows notifications to be sent when there are Purchase Orders to approve, improving response times to urgent requests for approval.

# <div id="test"> Purpose </div>
This is an informal document intended as an aide-memoire for the GHA Solutions and Site teams. The GHA Solutions team will record comments and recommendations when they occur during the project implementation. These may subsequently be revised, but it should not be assumed the details in the document are current. 

>NB â€“ the screen shots in the following sections are displayed in an Outlook theme in Epicor.  This is for display purposes and the functional screens with any Epicor theme work the same way, although the look will be different.

Assumptions
>Only the latest version of the Mobile Application will be used
>The implementation team are fully conversant with the standard Epicor Field Service module
>Any data in the Epicor database is the checked prior to loading into the MFS database

# MFS

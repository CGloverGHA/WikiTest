# <div id="test"> Creating Service Calls </div>

When a call is required for a customer/site, it will be necessary to create a Service Call and associated Service Job in Epicor.  Once the service call and job have been created, these are automatically broadcast to the Mobile Field Service for the technician(s).

## Service Calls
To create a Service Call, either create a case in CRM and create a service call from there, or open the service call screen directly.

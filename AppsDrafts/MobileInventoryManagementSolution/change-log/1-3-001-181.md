## 1.3.001+181
### 1. Registration Barcode Changes To Staging
The QR code scanned on the barcode will now read the staging environment using `stage` rather than `staging`. e.g. `ConnectionString~CompanyCode~stage`

### 2. App Environment Banner
In test versions of the app, a banner will now appear at the bottom of the app showing the Environment and whether it is a test device

If the text overflows, the banner will become horizontally scrollable.

### 3. Login Changes
- The Format Exception that appears when logging in should be gone now
- Unregister device will clear the saved Employee and Site
- Sites won't be loaded when no saved Employee has been restored
- Fixed `Environment Not Set` message that appeared when registering sometimes

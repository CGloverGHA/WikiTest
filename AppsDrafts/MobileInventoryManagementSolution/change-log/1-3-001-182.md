## 1.3.001+182 `(07/11/23)`
### 1. Bin Enquiry (`MIMS000058`, `MIMS000059` & `MIMS000060`)
Added the Bin Enquiry applet.
- Supports Lot Tracked Parts
- Supports Camera Scanning
- Supports DW Scanning

### 2. Show Environment Banner (`MIMS000078`)
The banner has now been moved to the top of the layout so the bar, at the bottom of iOS devices, does not overlap the banner.

The layout now adapts to the size of the screen with the banner in place so the pages are no longer cut off

### 3. Support Symbols In Part Enquiry (`MIMS000076`)
Previously, if a Part Number that contained a symbol (such as '#'), an error would be returned. Now any input in the app should be correctly encoded when sent to the REST API, fixing this problem.

### 4. Clear Autocomplete Field (`MIMS000067`)
Autocomplete fields now contain a `x` button to delete the contents of that field.

This currently only applies to the login screen.
- When the Site is cleared, so is the PIN
- When the Employee is cleared, so is the PIN & Site

The Site is now also cleared when selecting an Employee

### 5. Fixed Autocomplete Suggestion Width (`MIMS000083`)
Previously, the autocomplete field suggestions would extend past the field's length, now it is equal.

### 6. Show Employee On Layout (`MIMS000084`)
Now all pages, past the login screen, will display the employee name

### 7. CAB Version Warning (`MIMS000081`)
A warning message will be displayed, when the User logs in, if the installed CAB Version in Epicor does not match the CAB version expected by the app.

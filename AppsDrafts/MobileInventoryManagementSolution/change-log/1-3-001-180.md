## 1.3.001+180
### 1. Apply Theme From `ThemeCubit` (`MIMS000056`)
The theme is now applied from the license portal
- The theme is retrieved when registering
- The theme is retrieved when the app launches

### 2. Login (`MIMS000049`)
#### 2.1 Enabled Fields (`MIMS000066`)
- The Site field is disabled until an Employee is selected
- The PIN field is disabled unless the Employee has a PIN defined in Epicor
- The Login button is disabled until an Employee, Site and PIN (where applicable) has been entered

#### 2.2 (BUG) Can Login Without Info (`MIMS000065`)
[2.1 Enabled Fields (`MIMS000066`)](#2.1%20Enabled%20Fields%20(`MIMS000066`)) prevents users from being able to tap login before entering the required information.

Even if they are able to bypass this, the app now validates the form when the login button is tapped.

#### 2.3 Restore Last Login (`MIMS000067`)
After logging in, the Employee and Site will be saved.

On subsequent app launches, the Employee and Site will be restored on the login page

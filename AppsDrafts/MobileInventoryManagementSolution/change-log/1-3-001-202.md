A logging feature has been introduced to aid with bug reporting and replication.

On the Settings page, there is a new button to begin recording Trace and REST logs
- Trace logs include:
  - Button presses.
  - Dropdown items selected.
  - List items selected.
  - Text entered into fields.
  - And other background information.
- REST logs include:
  - Epicor REST calls with the endpoint, request payload, response payload status and message.
  
When the button is tapped, a banner is shown (or updated) that indicates that the app is recording logs.

This banner is visible throughout the app.

To stop logging, tap the `Stop Logging` button on the Settings page.

An option will appear to upload the logs to GHA.
- If `No` is tapped, the logs are discarded.
- If `Yes` is tapped, the logs are uploaded to GHA.

Trace logs are stored in the `mims.TraceLogs` table in the customer's database.
REST logs are stored in the `mims.RESTLogs` table in the customer's database.
